# Hello world!

  

Blogging from github hosting? Guess so!

  

Likely going to dump the paragraphs of knowledge i just cannot within tiny text drops like twitter or discord.

  

Need to understand markdown better. Github uses it and i find it everywhere in aftersight.

  

Looks like quick preview of image posting will be a pain... Need to host images early somewhere then link in. Gotta organize those file folders with a date of posting structure and be ready to recycle without hunt for "missing legos (images)".

  

Site updates comes from git commits. Without a dedicated markdown editor it looks like notpad++ and some online sites will be test preview until i get situated.

#### Spacing Test
How

Multi space in this markdown?

Maybe `<br/>` <br/><br/><br/><br/>

  

Oh.
Looks messy. Sometimes i expect the README.MD to be read raw yeah know? Users would just see it all. What a duality of formatting.
`<br/>`<br/>`<br/>`<br/>`<br/>`<br/>
Looks like MarkdownViewerPlusPlus for notepad++ can work. Got some online pages page previews and other tools not agreeing about formatting and spacing however. Big think.

#### Tables test:
| X | Y | Z |
|---|---|---|
| foo | bar | bazz |
| a | zyzw | need Coffee |

Eh? Works i guess. 

#### Link forma test:
<https://www.google.com>
#### Code Blocks?
```
color = max(0, color);
```
#### Quote test:

> Giant quote about about societies need to wage cage yet we really should us that time to self improve instead of buying 3 expensive houses and boats.

<br> <br>
#### Finish
Looks like everything is set for code log dumps, code samples, data,  photos, and citations.
